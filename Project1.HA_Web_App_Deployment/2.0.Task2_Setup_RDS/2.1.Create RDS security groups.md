**a. Create RDS security groups:**

From the VPC console select *'security groups'*. Create two security groups and name them differently, i.e. *databaserdssg1* and *databaserdssg2*. After creating the security groups, edit the inbound rules for *'databaserdssg1*' by creating a rule of type *MySQL/Aurora* to allow traffic on port *3306* from *'databaserdssg2'*. This will enable secure communication between the RDS instance and any EC2 instance associated with the *'databaserdssg2'* security group.
