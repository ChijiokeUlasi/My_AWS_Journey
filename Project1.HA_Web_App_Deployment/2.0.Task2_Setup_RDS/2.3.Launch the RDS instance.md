**Launch the RDS instance:**

We are going to create an RDS-managed database of type *MySQL*. Visit the RDS console and select *'databases'*. Then click *'create database'* and specify the RDS instance characteristics.

For your master password, you can choose to create your own, however, make sure to note down the password because it will be required while setting up network connectivity between the database and the WordPress instances. Also do not forget to select the correct VPC, security group (*databaserdssg1*) and subnet group (*DBsubnetgp*) created previously. Expand additional configuration and specify an initial database name (i.e. *wordpressDB*) and click *'create database'*.

***Note***: _You can choose to select the free-tier RDS instance type and single AZ to avoid any extra costs_.
