**Create a subnet group for RDS:**

During database deployment, you specify a subnet group which tells RDS in which subnets to deploy your database instances. To create, visit the RDS console and click *'subnet groups'* on the left panel and then select *'create DB subnet group'*;

Choose a name for your subnet group i.e. ‘*DBsubnetgp’*, and add the two *DBserver* subnets created in [Task 1](./1.0.Task1_Configure_VPC/1.2.Create_subnets_in_VPC) to your new subnet group. The subnet ID can be gotten from the subnet section of the VPC console.
