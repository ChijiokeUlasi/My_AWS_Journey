**A Highly Available 3-Tier Web Application Deployment**

This is the first in a 3-part series of walkthrough exercises aimed to
showcase my learning journey and also introduce the basic concepts and
services in AWS. The subsequent exercises are as well designed to be
progressive, hence, assisting anyone with interest gain some practical
hands-on experience in using AWS, beginning from the fundamentals to the
more advanced services.

In this exercise we will explore the implementation of the following AWS
services to build a highly available 3-tier web application;

-   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
