**Overview:**

As businesses around the world continue to evolve, there is always a
growing need to provide users with the best experience while accessing
our business products and services.

Web applications present a unique solution that removes the burden from
our users by serving all client requests from remote servers. This,
therefore, requires the need for a presentation layer (the user
interface), an application layer (the logic that executes the user\'s
requested task), and a database layer (the backend that stores any
necessary user information).

In this exercise, we will deploy a highly available and scalable 3-tier
WordPress application. The objective is to create a virtual network
spread across two availability zones, deploy a relational database using
amazon RDS, provision a shared storage layer using amazon EFS, and
create a load balanced group of web servers that will automatically
scale in response to user traffic.
