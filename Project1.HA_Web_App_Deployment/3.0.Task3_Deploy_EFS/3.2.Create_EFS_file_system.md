We are going to deploy EFS into the *Appserver* subnets created earlier. So, for network access, under 'mount targets', select the two *Appserver* subnets. For each mount target, associate the *'wpefssg1'* security group and remove the default security group. Accept the defaults in subsequent screens and click *'create'*.
