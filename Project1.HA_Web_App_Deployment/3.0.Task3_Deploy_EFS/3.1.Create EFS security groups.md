**Create EFS security groups:**

Navigate to the VPC console and create two security groups. Name them differently i.e. *'wpefssg1'* and *'wpefssg2'*. Edit the inbound rules for *wpefssg1* of type *NFS* to allow traffic on port *2049* from *wpefssg2*. This allows the EFS to be accessed only by instances associated with the *wpefssg2* security group.
