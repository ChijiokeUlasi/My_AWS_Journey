**a. Create Autoscaling group:**

To create, visit the EC2 console and select *'Autoscaling group'*. Choose a name for your ASG and select the launch template we just created. From subsequent screens, select your VPC and the ‘*Appserver’* subnets created in Task 1 (this is where the ASG will deploy our application instances). Under *'configure advanced options'* choose *'attach to an existing loadbalancer'* and select the target group we created in Task 4. To configure the group size, make sure the maximum capacity is higher than your desired capacity so as to enable scaling. Then, choose a scaling policy for your ASG.

Finally, accept the rest as defaults and click *'create autoscaling group'*. This will immediately initiate the creation of EC2 instances as defined in the launch template. Once the 'health status' of the targets in your target group is healthy, you can open the DNS name of your application load balancer in a web browser to view the welcome page of the WordPress web application.
