**b. Create load balancer:**

Navigate to the EC2 console and select *'load balancers'* on the left panel. We are going to deploy an application load balancer in our public subnet. So, click *'create'* under *'application load balancer'*, and under *'network mapping'*, select your VPC and the two *Pubserver* subnets created in Task 1.

Associate the security group you just created to the load balancer i.e. *'loadbalancersg1*' and remove the default security group. Under 'listeners and routing' we are going to create a new target group. So, click on *'create target group'* and give the target group a name without defining any targets i.e*. 'wptargetgroup'*. Refresh the 'listener' to select the target group created. In the summary tab, review and click *'create load balancer'*.
