**Create load balancer:**

Navigate to the EC2 console and select *'load balancers'* on the left panel. We are going to deploy an application load balancer in our public subnet. So, click *'create'* under *'application load balancer'*, and under *'network mapping'*, select your VPC and the two *Pubserver* subnets created in [Task 1](../1.0.Task1_Configure_VPC/1.2.Create_subnets_in_VPC.md).

Associate the security group you just created to the load balancer i.e. *'loadbalancersg1*' and remove the default security group. Under 'listeners and routing' we are going to create a new target group. So, click on *'create target group'* and give the target group a name without defining any targets i.e. *'wptargetgroup'*. Refresh the 'listener' to select the target group created. In the summary tab, review and click *'create load balancer'*.
