**Create load balancer security group:**

To create a security group for the load balancer, visit the VPC console. As in the previous steps, specify any name for your security group i.e. *'loadbalacersg1*'. Since the load balancer is internet-facing and public, edit the inbound rules for the security group to allow *'http*' traffic on port *80* from any IP address. Create a second security group i.e. *'loadbalancersg2'* and edit the inbound rules to allow only *'http'* traffic on port *80* from *loadbalancersg1*. This enables traffic from the load balancer into any EC2 instance associated with the *loadbancersg2* security group.
