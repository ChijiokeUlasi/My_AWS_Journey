## ï»¿Summary
 
Through the creation of an RDS database, EFS filesystem, Autoscaling group and application load balancer we have been able to deploy an independently scalable 3-tier WordPress application with the final configuration below;

Some of the benefits associated with this model include;

**1.** **Security:**
Since the functional layers of the application are separated into tiers, we can control communication between these tiers thereby preventing external attacks such as SQL injection.

**2.** **Performance/ Durability**:
Each tier can be developed independently to improve efficiency and also scale independently to improve application performance.

**3.** **Cost optimization**:
With this model, we can choose to allocate more or less resources to a particular 'tier' based on load or other pre-defined criteria, thereby efficiently managing operational cost.
