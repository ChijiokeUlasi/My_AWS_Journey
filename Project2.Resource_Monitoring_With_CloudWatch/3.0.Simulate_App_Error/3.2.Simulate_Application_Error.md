**Simulate Application Error:**

We will try to simulate an error in our web-app by making our backend servers (target group) unreachable from the application load balancer. To do this, navigate to the VPC console and select *'security group'* from the left panel. Now click the *'loadbalancerSG2'* security group (this is the security group associated with the ASG instances), edit the ‘inbound rule’ by removing the 'source' address (remember that this security group references the *loadbalancerSG1* security group). Once this is done, it triggers a *'504 gateway error'* when we try accessing our WordPress site from a web browser. Now visit the CloudWatch application insight dashboard to confirm this error.

To remediate this error, go back to the *'loadbalancerSG2'* security group and reattach the *'loadbalancerSG1*' security group as its 'source' address.
