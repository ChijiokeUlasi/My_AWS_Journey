### ï»¿Verify WordPress application functionality:

We need to ensure that our application is properly deployed and is in good initial state. To do this, we will finish the web-browser based installation and then try to generate traffic by making our first blog post.

From the initial WordPress installation welcome page, specify any site title, for username enter '*admin'*, and choose a password. Enter your email and click *'install WordPress'*. After the installation is complete, log in with the credentials you just created.

Now, to make our first blog post, click *'posts*' in the left menu and select *'Hello world'*. Click *'Bulk actions'* and select *'move to trash'*, then click *'apply*'. Now, click *'Add new'*, select any title for your blog post, click the '+' under 'title' and select *'Gallery*' to upload any image of your choice. Click '*publish*' twice and select *'view post'*. This is your first working WordPress blog site.
