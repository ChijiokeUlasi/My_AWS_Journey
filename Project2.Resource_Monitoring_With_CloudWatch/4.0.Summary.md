## ï»¿Summary:
 
Amazon CloudWatch provides you with the most reliable, scalable, and flexible way to monitor your applications or resources on AWS. It is designed to provide real-time insights into resource utilization, operational health and application performance.

Though there are more features offered by CloudWatch than can be explored in a single preview, we have seen from this exercise that by using the CloudWatch application insight, we can respond quickly to events or errors that occur at run-time in our cloud applications. It also supports automated remedial actions that can be configured by set rules to reduce human interaction with our deployed application resources.
