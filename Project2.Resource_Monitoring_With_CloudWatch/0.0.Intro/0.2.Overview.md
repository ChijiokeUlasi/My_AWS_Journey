**Overview:**

Building modern applications to scale and maintain optimum performance have become complex overtime. Notwithstanding, achieving application success amidst this complexity will mean better results and improved business outcomes.

The need, therefore, for a good monitoring system for our applications cannot be over-emphasized especially in this world of business. However, monitoring distributed applications and resources can be a challenging task because of issues ranging from bad dependency, bad component, bad deployment, traffic spikes etc.

In this exercise, we will enable a simple but efficient automated monitoring system for our WordPress web application. The objective is to create a 'Resource group' that includes all the components of our WordPress web-app and configure 'CloudWatch application insight' to gain observability into various performance metrics of each component contained in the resource group.

Note: This exercise is designed for training purposes. There are limitations to using CloudWatch application insight with WordPress. For supported native application frameworks see [What is Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights? - Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/appinsights-what-is.html#appinsights-stack) .
