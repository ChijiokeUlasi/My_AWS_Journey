**a. Setup Application insight**:

Navigate to the CloudWatch console and select *'Application insight'* from the left panel. Click *'Add an application'*. From the 'choose application types' page, select *'resource group-based application'*. Find and select the resource group we created in TASK 1 i.e., wordpress\_App and check *'Automatically monitor resources added to this application after onboarding'* box to automatically allow onboarding of new components in the future.

Note: You can optionally select *'Generate systems manager OpsCenter OpsItems for remedial actions'* to integrate application insight with SSM OpsCenter'. This helps for central location where operations engineers can view, investigate and resolve operational work items (called OpsItems).

On the 'review detected components' page, select any component, click *'Edit component'* to adjust monitoring configurations then *'save changes*' and click '*Next*'. Accept the rest as defaults, review the monitoring settings and click '*submit*'.
