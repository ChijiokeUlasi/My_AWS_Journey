**Setup Application insight**:

Navigate to the CloudWatch console and select *'Application insight'* from the left panel. Click *'Add an application'*. From the 'choose application types' page, select *'resource group-based application'*. Find and select the resource group we created in [TASK 1](../1.0.Task1_Create_ResourceGroup/1.2.Create_ResourceGroup.md) i.e., wordpress\_App and check *'Automatically monitor resources added to this application after onboarding'* box to automatically allow onboarding of new components in the future.

***Note***: _You can optionally select *'Generate systems manager OpsCenter OpsItems for remedial actions'* to integrate application insight with SSM OpsCenter'. This helps for central location where operations engineers can view, investigate and resolve operational work items (called OpsItems)_.

On the 'review detected components' page, select any component, click *'Edit component'* to adjust monitoring configurations then *'save changes*' and click '*Next*'. Accept the rest as defaults, review the monitoring settings and click '*submit*'.
