**b. Create Resource group**:

From the left panel, under resources section, select *'create resource group'*. Choose *'tag based'* and under 'grouping criteria' from the drop-down menu, select *'resource types'* (choose your resource types as you did in the previous section).

For *'tags*', enter the values you created earlier i.e., 'tag key'=*wordpress,* 'tag value'=*app*, and click '*add*'. Next, select *'preview group resources*' and specify a name for your resource group i.e., wordpress\_App, then click *'create group'*.

Note: Deleting a resource group does not delete the corresponding deployed resources.
