**Activate cost allocation tag:**

From the previous exercise, we were able to tag our WordPress application components using the 'Resource Group and Tag Editor' console. We will now activate the tag we created as a cost center tag. This enables us visualize our application spend as a single resource group using cost explorer. To activate, visit the 'Billing and Cost Management' console and select *'Cost allocation tag'* from the left panel. Search for our tag-key under 'user-defined cost allocation tags', select and click *'activate'.*

***Note***: _After you create your tag using 'Tag Editor', it may take up to 24hrs before it appears in the 'cost allocation tag' console page, and after activation, it may take another 24hrs before it is available in *'*cost explorer*'* for viewing_.


By default, you cannot view billing information prior to the date the 'cost allocation tag' was activated. To remedy this, make sure your activated tag is selected, click *'Backfill tags'*. Choose the month you wish to start viewing billing information and click *'confirm'.*

***Note***: _It may take 24hrs or more before the back-dated billing information is made available for viewing in 'Cost Explorer'_.
