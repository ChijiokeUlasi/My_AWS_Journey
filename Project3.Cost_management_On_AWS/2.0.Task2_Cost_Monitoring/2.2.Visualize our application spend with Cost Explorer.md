**b. Visualize our application spend with Cost Explorer:**

From the left panel of the 'Billing and Cost Management' console select *'Cost Explorer'*. To view the cost specifically associated with our WordPress application resources, from the 'Report Parameters' section, change 'Date range' to reflect desired parameter. Under 'granularity' choose *'monthly*'. Then under 'Group by', change Dimension to '*tag*' and select our activated cost center tag.

Now, notice the ‘*No tag key: wordpress’* value on our cost report, this signifies that there are untagged components associated with our WordPress application (AWS separates the main component from its network interfaces i.e., the EFS filesystem is tagged separately from the network interfaces attached to the mount targets, and there are also other resources that cannot be tagged i.e., data transfer. To identify these untagged resources, go to the ‘Tag’ selector under ‘Filters’ and choose your cost center tag. Select ‘*Includes’* for ‘No tag key:xxx’ and use a combination of the ‘*services*’ and ‘*Resources*’ drop-down to filter out the untagged components. 


Note: To view resource level cost report, you need to enable this feature by visiting ‘cost management preferences’ on the left panel of your ‘Billing’ console.
