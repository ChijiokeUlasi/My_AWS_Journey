Next, specify a name for your budget and provide your budgeted amount (the cost estimate from the Pricing calculator will serve as a reference guide). Under 'Budget Scope', select *‘Filter specific AWS cost dimensions’.* Click *‘Add filter’* and select *'Tag*' from the ‘Dimension’ drop-down, then find and select your tag-key i.e. wordpress. Under the 'Values' drop-down, choose the tag-value associated with your tag-key i.e. *App,* and then click *'apply filter'*.

You can set alert thresholds and also specify your notification preferences by clicking *'add an alert threshold'*. You can optionally attach budget actions to define what happens when your alert threshold is exceeded (this requires necessary IAM roles to be attached to AWS Budgets for successful execution).
